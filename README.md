# Image_to-_text_extraction
## Description
This project demonstrates how to extract text from an image using Python. The code leverages the Pillow library for image processing and Tesseract OCR (pytesseract) for text recognition. Additionally, it uses Google Colab's file upload functionality to upload images and extract the text content dynamically.
